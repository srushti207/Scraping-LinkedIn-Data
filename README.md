## Task: Scraping LinkedIn Data
Instructions:
Write a Python script to scrape LinkedIn profiles to gather the following information:

2) Their current companies and industries.
Your task is to:

Use the BeautifulSoup or Selenium library to scrape LinkedIn data (assume you have access to the LinkedIn page HTML or valid credentials for scraping).
